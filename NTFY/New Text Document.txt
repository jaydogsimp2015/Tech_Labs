**Expanding a Virtual Disk in Proxmox and Resizing the Filesystem**

If you have expanded a virtual disk in Proxmox but your partition is still showing the old size, follow these steps to extend the partition and filesystem without rebooting.

---

### **Step 1: Verify the Current Disk and Partition Size**
Before making changes, check the current size of the disk and partitions:
```bash
lsblk
```
Check the filesystem type:
```bash
df -Th
```
Look for `/dev/sda2` and confirm that it is an **ext4** partition.

---

### **Step 2: Extend the Partition**
Since your disk (`/dev/sda`) has been expanded in Proxmox but the partition (`/dev/sda2`) is still smaller, extend it with:
```bash
growpart /dev/sda 2
```
This command resizes the partition to use the available space on the disk.

---

### **Step 3: Resize the Filesystem**
After resizing the partition, extend the filesystem so it can use the new space. Since `/dev/sda2` is formatted as **ext4**, use:
```bash
resize2fs /dev/sda2
```
This will expand the filesystem to fill the resized partition.

---

### **Step 4: Verify the New Size**
Check if the partition has been extended successfully:
```bash
df -h
```
You should now see `/dev/sda2` using the full allocated space.

---

### **Example Before & After**
#### **Before Expansion:**
```
/dev/sda      96G  0 disk
â”œâ”€/dev/sda1    1M  0 part
â””â”€/dev/sda2   32G  0 part  ext4
```
#### **After Expansion:**
```
/dev/sda      96G  0 disk
â”œâ”€/dev/sda1    1M  0 part
â””â”€/dev/sda2   96G  0 part  ext4
```

---

### **Troubleshooting**
- If `growpart` is not found, install `cloud-utils-growpart`:
  ```bash
  apt install cloud-guest-utils
  ```
- If `resize2fs` fails, ensure the partition is not mounted as read-only.
- If using **LVM**, additional steps may be required to resize the logical volume (`lvextend`).

Now your VM's disk is fully expanded without requiring a reboot! ðŸš€
