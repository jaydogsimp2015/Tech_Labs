#1 Ticket A: no one was able to access the server so the problem has to be on the routers side or the servers side 
   
   Ticket B: acc2 cant access the server and the other devices can access the server so the problem is on acc2's side 

   Ticket C: Op2 can't cennect to anything on the network so I can determine what the problem is by checking the connection
   
   Ticket D: Sales 3 canâ€™t connect to anyone on the network again I determined the issue is sales 3 connection to the switch




#2 Ticket A: The entire network was being affected
   
   Ticket B: Acc2 was the only workstation affected 
  
   Ticket c: Ops2 is the only Work station affect

   Ticket D: Sales 3 Work station was affected



#3 Ticket A: The switch port connected to the server from the central router was turned off 
   
   Ticket B: The settings in acc2's work station NIC was changed from DHCP to static   

   Ticket C: The Nic was removed from op2's work station 
   
   Ticket D: The port that sales 3 connects to on the switch was turned off  




#4 Layer 1 , 2 and 3 of the TCP/IP suite 

#5  As a IT enrty level technician, my responsibilities would be more related to the helpdesk side of things like computer hardware,
    software, peripheral, anti-virus/malware as opposed to network administration so at most I might be able to check the connection
    between the data drop (ethernet wallplate and the pc to ensure the connecion is good there). If it is and I didn't detect malware
    of any kind, I'd escalate to the network administrator. 
  


#6 It made more sense to complete ticket A first because the problem was more severe due to it affecting access to the server for all devices

#7 Yes due the process of elimination and the information provided in the tickets I was able successfully figure out which layer was being affected 

#8 Ticket A : Due to no one being able to access the server I determined it was a layer 1 (physical) issue and was the connection between the server and the router after taking a look at the connection on the router I saw the switch port had been turned off not allowing a connection between the router and the server.
